1) Welcome back! Class debreif and student expectations
    - For the first term we will foucs on J4 and J5
    - If you continue next term after the CCC then we have fun (for example, building your own pac-man AI and using APIs)
    - This class is meant to be challenging and you are expected to put your blood, sweat and tears
      if you plan on doing well.
    - I am not a mean teacher but I have high standards especially for older students. If you do not pay attention
      in class and you do not put in the effort to learn what I have to teach you then that is your lost. You wasted
      your own time and your parent money. That being said I take pride in making sure I explain everything single thing
      and I am always happy to help you out even after class. Do not be afriad to ask questions. 

2) Look at the class website. Make sure you bookmark it. For new students feel free to look at what we did in the summer but you
   do not have to.
