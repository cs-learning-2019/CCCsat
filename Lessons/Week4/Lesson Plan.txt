1) Now that we have a baseline for GT, lets talk about two very important graph traversal algorithms. BFS and DFS.
For BFS if you are confused then this video is helpful https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDqjPvD54Ss
For DFS you can watch this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fujbpJ0LB4

2) Talk about how to answer J5 from 2019

3) Answer this DFS question
  - Use DFS to detect if a cycle exist in a undirected and directed graph (Can we do it using recursion and iteration methods?)

4) Do a BFS question (array traversal)
