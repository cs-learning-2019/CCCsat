1) Ice breaker question: 1080p/240fps or 4K/30fps also in a zombie infested world would you take a shotgun, pistol or assualt rifle.

2) Take up the code for 2018 and 2017 J4 (Doing the questions was your homework)

3) Discuss J5 2017 and how to tackle this problem
- What is counting sort
- Is there an alternative solution to J5 2017?

# First get the input
N = int(input())
wood = input().split(" ")

# Create data structures to hold on to data
size_to_number_of_wood = [0] * 2001
heights_to_number_of_boards = [0] * 4001

# Process the wood input (list of given wood sizes)
# We need to count how many pieces of wood we have of each size
for wood_size in wood:
    size_to_number_of_wood[int(wood_size)] += 1

# Determine the number of boards we can create for each size
<Students will fill this in>


# Get the longest length of fence and how many different height can be used
<Students will fill this in>

# Print the answer
print(longest_length, number_of_possible_heights)
