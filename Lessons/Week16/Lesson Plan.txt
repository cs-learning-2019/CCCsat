1) Talk about queues and stacks. What if we had a line up but some people were special and get special treatment.
   We could sort the line up by priority and always serve the first person in line. If a new person enters then we
   can do a linear search to find the correct placement for the new person.

2) Introduce priority queues and MIN/MAX heaps

3) See the code for MIN/MAX heaps

4) Use MIN/MAX heaps to solve problems
