1) Taking a closer look at generating fib seq and dynamic programming
- Brute force algorithm (simple recursion)
- What exactly is dynamic programming
- Dynamic programming method for fib

2) The hard part for most DP problems is figuring out the recursive relationship
that defines what the solution to n is based on previous values. In otherwords,
how do I form the solution to my problem by using the result of smaller problems.

Lets take a look at two relatively simple examples from a text book

3) Now lets take a look at a DP problem and code up the solution.

4) work on J5 for 2015
