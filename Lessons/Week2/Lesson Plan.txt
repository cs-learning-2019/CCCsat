1) Take up 2021 J4 and J5 code (doing these questions was your homework)

2) Take a look at J3 and J4 from 2020

3) Look at J4 from 2019

4) If time permits then look at DFS and BFS and graph theory
- What is a graph?
- what are nodes/vertices? What is an adjacent node/neighbour?
- Degree of a vertex?
- What about cycles in a graph?
- What the different kinds of grpahs?
   - Connected vs non-connected
   - Directed vs non-directed
   - Weighted vs non-weighted
   - What is a tree (Connected aycylic graph, leaf has degree 1)?
- What is a walk and path in GT?
- What kinds of applications?
- Adjacency Matrix and Adjacency List (BTW this is a great website for this https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-and-its-representations/)

5) Now that we have a baseline for GT, lets talk about two very important graph traversal algorithms. BFS and DFS.
For BFS if you are confused then this video is helpful https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDqjPvD54Ss
For DFS you can watch this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fujbpJ0LB4
