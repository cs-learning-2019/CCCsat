1) Ensure you can login into the CCC online grader

2) In the CCC online grader work on CCC 2010 Junior.
Specifically I want you to work on question 2 and 3 for homework.
So that is "Up and Down" and "Punchy"

3) You do not need to do this for homework but if you want to challenge yourself 
then please try question 4, "Global Warming"


NOTE: YOU MUST SUBMIT THE FILES USING THE CCC ONLINE GRADER LIKE I SHOWED YOU IN CLASS!!!
