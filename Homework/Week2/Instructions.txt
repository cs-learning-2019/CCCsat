For homework you are required to write code to solve the following problems.
For each question you are required to create a new Python file. 
For example, for the first the first question you will have question1.py.
For the second question you will have question2.py and etc.
You will hand in the homework using the chat at the beginning of next class.
What you should do is put all your Python files into one folder called CCC_Week2_HW
and zip/compress it into a zip file so CCC_Week2_HW.zip. You will hand in the zip file to me.
Look here if you do not know how to zip a folder

Question 1
Given a list of numbers sort it from largest to smallest and print the new list to the console. Hint: there is a built-in
function/method that you can use to sort a Python List. I suggest you search it up if you do not know it.

Below is some code to start you off

list_of_nums = [2, 1, 0, 0, -1, 5, 9, 10, 11, 3, 6, 5]
<blah blah>
<blah blah>
<blah blah>
<blah blah>
print(sorted_list_of_nums)


Question 2
Given a list of names and a separate list containing the ages of those people, create a dictionary which maps ages to the list
of names who have that age. Confusing right? Ok I will give you an exmaple...

names = ["Kelly", "John", "Kevin", "Tony", "Jack", "Wilson", "Tina", "Cab"]
ages = [7, 5, 6, 8, 7, 6, 5, 7]

From the two list above you can tell that Kelly is 7, John is 5, Kevin is 6, Tony is 8 Jack is 7 and so on... you get the point.
Your goal is to create a dictionary that looks like the following...
output = {7:["Kelly", "Jack", "Cab"], 5:["John", "Tina"], 6:["Kevin", "Wilson"], 8:["Tony"]}


Question 3
Along with the instructions for the homework you should see a file called input.txt. You can download this file from github
or you can simply copy and paste to create you own copy on your computer.

input.txt is a simple text file containing first and last name pairs (one first and last name per row).

Your job is to write python code to read in the text file and store the first and last names in two separate list. At the end your 
program should print the two lists to the console. Note: For this question you may find the split function/method useful.

Note: This homework is meant to be easy though question 2 is a bit harder.
