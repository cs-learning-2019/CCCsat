1) Go to Microsoft Teams and ensure you are able to watch the class recording.
   If you are not able to watch the recoding then please contact me ASAP through teams (just direct message me).

2) Download and install Python https://www.python.org/downloads/ as I have shown you in class. You do not need to do this if you already have Python.
   Note: if you forgot then you can watch the class recording to help you.

3) You have Python installed open up IDLE and open a new file. Then write some simple code and run the code and see if it works.
   If the code does not run or Python does not work then something went wrong and we can sort it out next class.

4) Create an account for CCC here https://cccgrader.com/index.php   Our school number is 057007907

5) Review Python Dicts https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_dictionaries.asp

6) Enjoy your Canada Day Weekend. Next week will be much heavier.

REMEMBER IF SOMETHING IS NOT CLEAR THEN MAKE SURE TO WATCH THE CLASS RECORDING AND ALSO CHECK THE LESSON FILES!!!
DO NOT BE LAZY!!!
