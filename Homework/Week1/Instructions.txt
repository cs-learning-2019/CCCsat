Answer the following questions

1) In class I showed you the code for Min Heaps. I want you to code Max Heaps. Feel free to copy my code and
   make edits. It should be very similar to the Min Heap code.

2) Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns True if the array satisfies the min heap property

3) Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns the sorted array. You need to sort from smallest to highest.
   For sorting you are not allowed to use the the sort() method/function. You need to only use min heaps to solve this problem.
   Note: this is called the heap sorting algorithm
