1) I recommend you review the code we covered in class and also look at the websites I recommended.

2) I want you to write a neural network to solve a linear exmaple. There is a blue line and
and red line. The neural net should be able to learn where the red and blue are. So if I give
the neural network the x and y coordinates then the output should be a 0 or 1 (0=red and 1=blue).
The data and graph is provided to you.
